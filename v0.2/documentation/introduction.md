qb is a database toolkit for easier implementation for db heavy apps in go. The aim is to build a lightweight architecture on top of [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) library for painless db implementation in go. It is inspired from python's most favorite sql package called [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

- Support for postgres, mysql, mariadb & sqlite
- A simple query builder api
- A transactional session api implemented on top of query builder that have commonly used db queries such as Find(), All(), etc.
- A metadata api where tables can be generated and created from structs
- A struct to table mapper with use of tagging
- A query to struct mapper with use of sqlx library
- Foreign key reference definitions with use of tagging
- Single & composite column indices with use of tagging
- Relationships (coming soon..)

The reason this package is being developed is mainly because of my personal curiosity. It is currently a hobby project of mine. However, there are more several reasons. I have played with most of the ormish libraries in go. At the time, neither of them were complete and there is a quite good [post](http://www.hydrogen18.com/blog/golang-orms-and-why-im-still-not-using-one.html) about that which resonates the point.

Moreover, there is this tweet I had posted about the go orm world;

From my perspective, I think qb solves most of the problems I'm suffering when using an orm in go and hopefully, it would be useful to anyone that has the similar problems with me.

To install qb, a simple go get would do the trick;
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "go get -v -u github.com/aacanakin/qb",
      "language": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
To get the test dependencies add a -t flag;
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "go get -v -u -t github.com/aacanakin/qb",
      "language": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Moreover, [glide](https://glide.sh/) is also supported;
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "glide get github.com/aacanakin/qb",
      "language": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
